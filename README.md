A VERY opinionated Spotify client. Find out how bad your music taste really is.

Snobify is a music analysis tool and Spotify client that scores a user's listening history
and provides specific feedback on their currently playing track. The app generates a score
based on how generic and popular the user's recently listened tracks are, with the aim of
encouraging listeners to diversify their music taste. Snobify uses artificial intelligence
to provide unique responses about the user's currently playing track, offering insights
into their musical preferences and helping them discover new and less popular artists and
genres. Whether you're a casual listener or a music connoisseur, Snobify is the perfect tool
to help you explore and expand your musical horizons.
